A little one-way putio syncer thingy. Useful to download (and then delete
remote copies of) files from put.io.

## TODO list

* [x] Multiple sync sources
* [x] User-configurable concurrent downloads
* [x] User-configurable scan interval
* [x] Graceful shutdown everywhere
* [x] File hash validation
* [x] Rate limiting
* [ ] Concurrency across multiple sync sources
* [ ] Auto directory creation for bare files
* [ ] User-configurable deletion semantics
* [ ] Staging / completed folders
